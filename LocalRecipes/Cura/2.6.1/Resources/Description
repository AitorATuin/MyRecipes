[Name] Cura
[Summary] 3D printer / slicing GUI built on top of the Uranium framework 
[Description] This is the new, shiny frontend for Cura. daid/Cura is the old
legacy Cura that everyone knows and loves/hates.
We re-worked the whole GUI code at Ultimaker, because the old code started to
become a unmaintainable.
